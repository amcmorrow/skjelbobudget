# Household Budget

A self-hosted budgeting app for two-person households, inspired by YNAB and Mint. Runs on a VPS behind nginx/Caddy. Zero recurring fees beyond your server cost.

> **Hey Sabrina** 👋 — I hope this works for you.

## What it does

- **Hybrid envelope budgeting** — assign every dollar to a category, with carryover from month to month (YNAB-style), plus Mint-style reports on top.
- **Two-user authentication** — exactly two logins, hard-capped at the model layer. Shared household data; either user sees everything.
- **Multiple financial accounts** — checking, savings, credit cards, cash, plus off-budget investment/loan accounts. One-click transfers.
- **Three ways to ingest transactions** — manual entry, CSV import (auto-detects most bank formats and de-duplicates), or optional Plaid sync (automatic bank connection).
- **Savings goals** — target amount + date, log contributions, progress bars.
- **Recurring transactions** — schedule bills and paychecks on any cadence; the processor catches up automatically.

## Features

### Home / Dashboard
The home page combines a spending reports view and a calendar in one place:

- **Spending by Category** and **Spending by Payee** doughnut charts with configurable date ranges (Last 30/90/180/365 days, This Month, Last Month, Last 3/6/12/24 months, This Year, Last Year, Custom).
- **Monthly Spend by Category** stacked bar chart for trend analysis.
- **Categories tab** — grouped progress bars showing budget vs. spent for the current month, with avg/month, last month, and budgeted columns. Budget amounts are **inline-editable** directly from this table.
- **Payees tab** — same layout, organized by payee with spend totals and averages.
- Hover over any category or payee row to see a tooltip with its 8 most recent transactions (including memos).
- Click any category or payee to open a transaction panel for the selected date range — all fields **inline-editable** (payee, memo, amount, category, date, account).
- **FullCalendar** view showing all transactions color-coded by category, with daily net totals on each cell. Optionally overlays your Google Calendar events.
- Clicking a calendar transaction navigates to the Transactions page pre-filtered by that category.

### Transactions
- Full transaction list with inline editing for every field.
- **Tag cloud filter** — click any combination of category and payee pills to filter instantly, with live counts that update as you select.
- **Date range filter** — same presets as the home page plus a custom date picker. All client-side, instant filtering with no page reload.
- Summary bar showing visible transaction count, total expenses, total income, and net — updates live as filters change.
- Clicking the colored dot or ⊕ icon on any row adds that category or payee to the active tag filter.

### Categories
- Inline-editable category names — click any name to rename it.
- Inline-editable group headers — click a group name to rename the entire group at once.
- Move categories between groups via the group dropdown on each row.
- Income toggle checkbox per category.
- Add new categories with auto-suggest for existing group names.

### Budget Page
- YNAB-style envelope budgeting by month.
- "To Be Budgeted" computed live from income minus assigned amounts.
- Click any budgeted amount to edit it inline.
- Navigate between months with prev/next arrows.

### Plaid (Automatic Bank Sync)
- Connect your real bank account via [Plaid](https://plaid.com). Supports production (real banks) and sandbox (test credentials) environments.
- After linking, hit **Sync now** on the Plaid page to pull in new transactions.
- Works with most US banks. OAuth banks (Chase, BofA, etc.) redirect through the bank's login page.

### Other Pages
- **Accounts** — manage accounts, mark as closed/off-budget, view balances.
- **Goals** — savings goals with target amount, target date, and contribution tracking.
- **Recurring** — scheduled transactions (bills, paychecks) on any interval.
- **Import CSV** — paste or upload a bank CSV; the importer auto-detects column formats and skips duplicates.

## Setup

### Requirements
- Python 3.12+
- A Linux server (Ubuntu 24.04 recommended)
- Optional: a [Plaid](https://dashboard.plaid.com/signup) account (free sandbox tier works for testing)
- Optional: a public Google Calendar ICS URL

### Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:

```bash
SECRET_KEY=<long random hex string>   # required — generate with: openssl rand -hex 32

# Optional — Plaid bank sync
PLAID_CLIENT_ID=...
PLAID_SECRET=...
PLAID_ENV=production                  # or "sandbox" for testing with fake credentials

# Optional — Google Calendar overlay on the home calendar
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ICS=https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/...
```

The app works fine without Plaid or Google Calendar — those features simply won't appear.

### Local development

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export FLASK_ENV=development
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
flask run --debug
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:5000>. The dev database lives at `instance/budget.db`.

### Production (systemd + nginx or Caddy)

Full step-by-step in **[DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md)**. The short version:

1. Clone the repo to your server
2. Create `.env` with a strong `SECRET_KEY`
3. Install dependencies into a virtualenv
4. Set up a systemd service (see `deploy/budget.service`)
5. Point nginx or Caddy at `127.0.0.1:8000`
6. Add a nightly backup cron (see `scripts/backup.sh`)

### File layout

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `app.py` | Flask app factory, all routes, query helpers. |
| `auth.py` | Login/logout/setup/user-management blueprint. |
| `models.py` | SQLAlchemy models. All money stored as integer cents. |
| `csv_import.py` | Bank CSV parser with column auto-detection and deduplication. |
| `plaid_client.py` | Optional Plaid integration (link tokens, token exchange, sync). |
| `recurring.py` | Posts due recurring transactions on each authenticated request. |
| `templates/` | Jinja2 templates — Bootstrap 5.3, Chart.js 4.4, FullCalendar 6. |
| `static/style.css` | Custom CSS on top of Bootstrap. |
| `deploy/budget.service` | systemd unit file. |
| `scripts/backup.sh` | Nightly sqlite3 `.backup` → gzipped snapshot, 30-day retention. |
| `.env.example` | All supported env vars with descriptions; copy to `.env`. |

### Data model notes

All amounts are stored as **integer cents** — `$4.75` is stored as `475`. This eliminates floating-point drift.

`Transaction.amount` is signed: negative = outflow, positive = inflow. Transfers are two transactions linked by a `transfer_id` UUID.

`BudgetMonth` rows hold the envelope assignment per `(year, month, category_id)`. Available balance is computed live:

```
available = carryover + assigned + spent     (spent is always negative)
```

Surplus rolls forward automatically. Overspending reduces next month's "To Be Budgeted."

## Security

- HTTPS via Caddy auto-TLS or your own cert
- Secure HttpOnly SameSite=Lax session cookies
- Scrypt-hashed passwords (10-char minimum enforced)
- CSRF protection on every form and every AJAX POST
- Rate-limited login endpoint (10 attempts / 5 min / IP)
- App refuses to start without a real `SECRET_KEY`
- All secrets in `.env` (gitignored); nothing sensitive hardcoded

## CLI

Run with the virtualenv active:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `flask create-user email@x.com --admin` | Create a user (hard cap: 2 total). |
| `flask reset-password email@x.com` | Reset a password from the shell. |
